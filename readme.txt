**Click to Tweet: The #1 WordPress Plugin for Twitter**

Click to Tweet is the easiest way to promote your content and encourage your audience to share it on Twitter through active prompts and optimal usability.

So how does it work? After installation and activation, bloggers and content managers can create click to tweet text or image boxes comprised of relevant excerpts from a blog post or page. Because the plugin accommodates a myriad of styles, if there’s new or revised content to disperse, Click to Tweet can facilitate it via highly customizable displays and themed templates.

Click to Tweet is the professional, noninvasive way to ask subscribers and visitors to share content while giving them a single-click pathway to completion. If you want your content to be shared, you absolutely must make it easy.

Click to Tweet is successful because of its simple, effective promotion that adheres to the character count parameters of Twitter. You can also include Twitter usernames automatically to increase social media followers even more!

**Plugin Features**

* Both the app and plugin are free to install and include five full-featured links with an automatic URL shortening service, full scale tracking including location, and analytics to monitor site traffic and overall engagement.
* Upgrades to unlimited plans are available for an affordable cost of $4.97 per month for Pro and $49.70 per year for Expert (receive 2 months free). Both membership options include unlimited links.
* Link tracking allows users to take advantage of automatic link shortening and statistics of each embedded link. Click tracking provides detailed analytics on the Click to Tweet link such as total number, date, and location of clicks.
* Click to Tweet links are automatically embedded and fully editable. Links can be categorized using folders by topic, date range, etc. for quick reference.
* Lots of themes to choose from to really make your tweetable links stand out!  Fully customize the display box that appears including colors, text, images, and more.

== Installation ==

There are 2 different ways to quickly and easily get this plugin installed on your website, listed below for your reference.

**WordPress Administrator Panel**

WordPress admin section installation is the easiest option to install a plugin as WordPress handles the file transfers itself. To complete a WordPress admin section installation for the Click To Tweet plugin, you’ll need to log in and navigate to the “Plugins” menu. Click on the “Add New” option at the top of the page.

In the search field at the right side, type *“click to tweet”* and perform the search. The first plugin listed is ours! Once you’ve found the plugin in the search results, you can view the details about it such as the point release, rating and description. In order to install the plugin, you just need to click “Install Now” and you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Please click “Yes” and WordPress will automatically complete the installation process.

Within the configuration file of your website, if **“FS_METHOD”** is set to direct and you try to install the plugin from the admin section, it will prompt you to fill in the FTP credentials of your website and upon posting the same, it will install the plugin.

**Using File Transfer Protocol**

The manual installation involves downloading the Click To Tweet plugin from the WordPress directory and then uploading it to your webserver via the FTP application. In this case, you need to perform the following steps:
1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it.
2. Using a FTP application, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the plugins menu within the admin section.

**Final Step**

Once you are finished with the installation process, head over to the **Settings -> Click To Tweet** menu in WordPress to ensure you can connect with your Twitter account.
